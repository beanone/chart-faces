		    	Chart-Faces is a high performance JSF component library that enables one to generate interactive charts.
		    	Since most charts are best represented as vector graphics, the charts are rendered as SVG. JSON is used
		    	to transport data. jQuery is extended to support AJAX behaviors. Custom JSON extension is implemented to
		    	represent array of DOM elements more efficiently. JavaScript event API is created to simplify support for
		    	dynamic behaviors.
	    	</p>
			<p>
				This site demonstrates the usage of the library with real JSF pages. Click through the site using the the
				left and top navigation. Look at the charts generated and experience the performance of the library. You
				may view the charts from all major browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc.) or from  your mobile
				devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is hosted on Google Code as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chart-faces/" target="_new">chart-faces</a>.
				The source code of the library is not yet available. I plan to release it by the end of year 2012. However,
				this should not stop you from exploring this demo site. If you have any suggestions or found a bug while
				exploring, please file an enhancement or bug request. Your interest in this project and your supported
				is always appreciated!
			</p>
			<p>
				The demo site is organized according to chart types on the left navigation bar. For each chart type, there
				are one or more demo pages, each shows a different usage. Each page has a number of tabs on the top. The
				"Usage" tab contains a brief summary of the usage and the resulting chart. "View Source" shows the
				original JSF source code. "Java Source" shows the backing bean and other Java source code used to
				support data binding. "Tag Information" shows the relevant tag API. If you would like to see what is
				actually rendered, right-click in the middle of the page and choose "View Source".
